# the-force-poc
Proof of concept for dynamically loading SPAs

## Running the app
If you just want to see the demo, you only need to worry about `the-force` directory and can safely ignore the source of the child applications.

* Install dependencies from `the-force` directory: `yarn install`.
* Run the app in watch mode `yarn start`.
* A browser window should open automatically to http://localhost:5000
